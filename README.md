# Advent of Code 2020
AoC aka the only way to get up before 8am.

## Introduction
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
